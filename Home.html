                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h4>Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market.
                        It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and
                        spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the
                        classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

                        <br><br>
                        Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and
                        become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip.
                        After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another
                        discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses,
                        and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to
                        Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter
                        as a coffeehouse.

                        <br><br> Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California,
                        Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in
                        Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to
                        welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of
                        neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission:
                        to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.
